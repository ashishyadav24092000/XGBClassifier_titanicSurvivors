# XGBClassifier_titanicSurvivors
In this problem i have tried to explain how XGB algorithm works in case of classification. I have also stated the accuracy score at the  end for our XGBClassifier model. The confusion matrix has also been shown for the same. I have used the Kaggle Dataset - Titanic Survivors csv file.
